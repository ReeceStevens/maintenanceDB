=============

Program Outline:

User inputs a inventory in .xls or .csv format.

Python script will parse the inventory file for the data we need (device name, 
serial no., date last serviced). Notification system will primarily use the 
installed os notification library (libnotify for linux, systray for Windows and Mac)

User interface will be coded in Python using QT
